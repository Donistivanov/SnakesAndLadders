## Assumptions:
- Players can overshoot the end, but are considered as ending up at 100
- Players do not move after a player wins
- The config.txt is present
- The config.txt is valid
  - The file should contain the correct new line endings for the system (the config.txt in this repo was made on a Windows machine)
  - Transitions (snakes and ladders) come in pairs separated by a space
  - Each transition is separated by a new line
  - If you want to override a previous transition, the parser will save the latest start/end pair
  - Transitions and player moves are separated by two new lines
  - Rolls of a player are not separated
  - The roll sets of players are separated by a new line
- It is allowed for a player to stop rolling but for other players to keep rolling.
- Game players can only be 0 at game start and 1-100 when on the board. (A config.txt can configure transitions to values outside of 0-100)
- Game players roll a 1d6. (Parsing can technically handle rolls from a 1d10 die (values 0-9))
- Game squares are either empty or have the bottom of a snake, or the top of a snake, or the bottom of a ladder, or a top of a ladder
